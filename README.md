# Mimas

Mimas[^1] is a simple[^2] full-stack web framework built on [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [**Pyodide**](https://pyodide.org/), and [**Pydantic**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) that lets you create classic single-page web applications talking to a REST API with pure Python, HTML, and CSS (yes, both the frontend and backend code is written in Python, no Javascript is needed).

At its current state, **Mimas should absolutely not be used in production** for various reasons. I just thought it would be a nice academic exercise.

If you like FastAPI and handcraft your HTML, CSS, and JS, [getting started with Mimas](https://github.com/felsenhower/mimas/wiki/Getting-Started) will be pretty easy for you.

[^1]: /ˈmíː.mas/ or /ˈmaɪməs/, named after the seventh-largest moon of Saturn which is itself named after a giant from Greek mythology, *Μίμας*. It also means something in Spanish and Latin, but I didn't know that when naming this project.

[^2]: *Simple* as in relatively easy to get started with, and as in only being a thin layer on top of some fat sophisticated libraries, not as in small and quick.
